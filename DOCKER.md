# Docker Deployment

This application can be deployed using Docker with minimal configuration. Existing deployments use separate frontend and backend containers; an additional opt-in full-stack image is available for users who prefer a single container. The existing images and `docker-compose.yml` remain supported and unchanged.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose (optional, but recommended)

## Quick Start (Using Pre-built Images from GHCR)

The fastest way to get started — no build required:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (pulls images automatically)
docker-compose up -d

# The application will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

> **Note:** If the GHCR package is set to private, you must authenticate before pulling:
> ```bash
> docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
> ```
> Use a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (with `read:packages` scope) as the password.

Available image tags (all role-specific images share the same tagging scheme):
- `latest` — latest build from the `main` branch
- `v0.8.1` — the exact release tag; it must match the root `package.json` client version
- `0.8.1`, `0.8`, `0` — convenience semver tags derived from the same `v0.8.1` release
- `sha-abc1234` — specific commit builds

The root `package.json` is the single version source for desktop clients and Docker releases. A release workflow rejects a Git tag unless it is exactly `v` plus that file's `version`, so matching release image tags and client versions are published together.

Published images:
- Frontend: `ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-frontend`
- Backend (canonical): `ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-backend`
- Full stack (optional): `ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-fullstack`
- Backend legacy compatibility alias: `ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-server`

The `-frontend`, `-backend`, and `-fullstack` names identify the image role consistently. The existing `-server` backend alias continues to receive the same tags so current `docker-compose.yml` and direct `docker run` deployments remain unchanged.

## Optional Single-Container Full-Stack Deployment

The full-stack image is an additional deployment option. It runs one Node/Express process that serves the web application, `/api`, and MCP endpoints from the same origin. It does **not** replace the standalone backend image, frontend image, or existing `docker-compose.yml` workflow.

Use the dedicated Compose file for the simplest setup. Before starting, create a `.env` file with an API secret; the full-stack Compose file refuses to start without it so a new network-facing deployment is not accidentally unauthenticated.

```bash
API_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
# Optional: set this to keep a chosen encryption key rather than generating one in the data volume.
# ENCRYPTION_KEY=replace-with-your-encryption-key

# This leaves docker-compose.yml unchanged for existing deployments.
docker compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml up -d

# Open the application at http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

You can also run the full-stack image directly. The data volume stores SQLite data and an automatically generated encryption key, so keep the `-v` option when upgrading or recreating the container. A direct `docker run` does not load Compose's `.env` file; export `IMAGE_TAG` (or replace it inline) to pin the image version.

```bash
# Set this to 0.8.1 for a version-pinned deployment, or latest for main.
export IMAGE_TAG=0.8.1

docker run -d \
  --name github-stars-manager-fullstack \
  -p 8080:3000 \
  -v github-stars-data:/app/data \
  -e API_SECRET="your-secret-here" \
  ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-fullstack:${IMAGE_TAG}
```

For a new deployment, omit `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the service generates a key in the persisted data volume. If an existing deployment already uses `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, always pass the **exact same value** on every recreation and during migration; an environment-provided key overrides the file key, and changing it makes already encrypted credentials unreadable.

For Compose deployments, add `IMAGE_TAG` to the same `.env` file to pin a full-stack version:

```bash
API_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
IMAGE_TAG=0.8.1
# Set this only when preserving an existing environment-provided key.
# ENCRYPTION_KEY=the-exact-existing-key
```

### Migrate an Existing Docker Compose Deployment

Migration is optional. Existing frontend-plus-backend deployments continue to work and require no action. If the current backend has an `API_SECRET`, preserve the exact value in the full-stack `.env`; this keeps current browser, API, and MCP clients authenticated without reconfiguration. If the existing backend has no `API_SECRET`, generate a strong new value in the full-stack `.env` and configure every direct API and MCP client with it after cutover; the full-stack Compose file intentionally does not start unauthenticated. If the existing service explicitly sets `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, copy the **same value** into the full-stack `.env` as well. Replace `<existing-backend-data-volume>` with the volume name returned by `docker volume ls`; when Compose is run from this repository with its default project name, it normally ends in `_backend-data`.

```bash
# Stop all SQLite writers without deleting the named data volume.
# Default Compose project name:
docker compose down
# If you use a custom project name, use it for every command below instead:
# docker compose -p <project-name> down

# Create a portable backup only after the database is quiesced.
docker run --rm \
  -v <existing-backend-data-volume>:/data:ro \
  -v "$PWD":/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/github-stars-manager-data-backup.tgz -C /data .

# Copy the current API_SECRET into .env before startup; copy the same
# ENCRYPTION_KEY too when the old service set one explicitly.
# Reuse the same Compose project directory and volume name.
docker compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml up -d
# For a custom project: docker compose -p <project-name> -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml up -d

# Verify the UI, API, and persisted data.
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

Both Compose files declare the same `backend-data` volume key. When they run from the same directory with the same Compose project name, the full-stack deployment reuses the existing SQLite database and `.encryption-key`. If you normally use `docker compose -p <project>`, pass the same `-p <project>` value for the migration command.

To roll back from a Compose deployment, stop the full-stack service and start the original split deployment again. If the full-stack service was created with direct `docker run`, stop and remove that container instead before starting Compose. Do not add `-v` to any of these commands, because that would delete the persisted data volume.

```bash
# Full-stack service started by Compose:
docker compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml down
# For a custom project: docker compose -p <project-name> -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml down

# Full-stack service started by direct docker run (use this instead of Compose down):
# docker stop github-stars-manager-fullstack
# docker rm github-stars-manager-fullstack

# Restore the existing split deployment.
docker compose up -d
# For a custom project: docker compose -p <project-name> up -d
```

To pin specific versions in `docker-compose.yml`, set `BACKEND_IMAGE_TAG` and/or
`FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG` in your `.env` file:

```bash
BACKEND_IMAGE_TAG=0.8.1
FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG=0.8.1
```

## Backend Server (docker run)

The backend image is published to GHCR and can be run standalone. New standalone deployments should use the canonical `-backend` image. The legacy `-server` image remains published with identical tags exclusively for existing `docker-compose.yml` and direct deployments, so no current user must change an image reference.

```bash
# Basic — no auth, port 3000, data persisted in volume
docker run -d \
  --name github-stars-backend \
  -v github-stars-data:/app/data \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-backend:latest

# With custom API secret and encryption key
docker run -d \
  --name github-stars-backend \
  -v github-stars-data:/app/data \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e API_SECRET="your-secret-here" \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-encryption-key" \
  ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-backend:latest

# Map to a different host port (e.g. 8080)
docker run -d \
  --name github-stars-backend \
  -v github-stars-data:/app/data \
  -p 8080:3000 \
  -e API_SECRET="your-secret-here" \
  ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-backend:latest
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `API_SECRET` | Optional for standalone backend | `null` (auth disabled) | Bearer token for API authentication. It is required by `docker-compose.fullstack.yml` so the new single-container web service cannot start unauthenticated. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | No | Auto-generated (saved to `data/.encryption-key`) | AES-256 key for encrypting stored secrets. Accepts any format — 64-char hex, shorter hex, base64, or plain text (all normalized via SHA-256) |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | Server listening port |
| `DB_PATH` | No | `data/data.db` | Path to SQLite database file |

> **Note:** The data volume (`/app/data`) stores both the database and the auto-generated encryption key. Always mount it to persist data across container restarts.

## Full Stack with Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` runs both frontend and backend:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To customize secrets and image versions, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
API_SECRET=my-strong-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=my-encryption-key
BACKEND_IMAGE_TAG=0.8.1    # pin backend image version (default: latest)
FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG=0.8.1   # pin frontend image version (default: latest)
# BACKEND_HOST=backend:3000 # target for the frontend's /api proxy (default: backend:3000)
```

Then `docker-compose up -d` reads them automatically.

## Building Locally with Docker

### Using Docker Compose (local build)

**Option A — Edit `docker-compose.yml` directly:**

Comment out the `image:` line and uncomment `build: ./server`, then:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Option B — Use an override file (no editing needed):**

Create `docker-compose.override.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./server
```

Then run `docker-compose up -d --build`. The override file takes precedence automatically. To switch back to GHCR images, simply delete the override file.

> **Note:** Do NOT commit the override file to git — it would force local builds for all users.

### Using Docker directly (frontend only)

The pre-built frontend image is published to GHCR — no local build required:

```bash
# Pull the published image
docker pull ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-frontend:latest

# Run the container (point /api proxy at your backend)
docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
  -e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal:3000 \
  --name github-stars-manager \
  ghcr.io/amintacccp/github-stars-manager-frontend:latest

# The application will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

> `BACKEND_HOST` sets the upstream the frontend proxies `/api/` to. In Docker Compose
> it defaults to `backend:3000`. When running standalone, point it at your backend's
> reachable address (e.g. `host.docker.internal:3000` on Docker Desktop, or the backend
> container's IP/host on a shared network).

To build the image locally instead (uses the repository `Dockerfile`):

```bash
docker build -t github-stars-manager .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
  -e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal:3000 \
  --name github-stars-manager github-stars-manager
```

## CORS Handling

This Docker setup handles CORS in two ways:

1. **Nginx CORS Headers**: The Nginx configuration adds appropriate CORS headers to allow API calls to external services.

2. **Client-Side Handling**: The application is designed to work with any AI or WebDAV service URL configured by the user, without requiring proxying.

## Stopping the Container

```bash
# With Docker Compose
docker-compose down

# With Docker directly
docker stop github-stars-manager && docker rm github-stars-manager

# Stop backend only
docker stop github-stars-backend && docker rm github-stars-backend
```

## Note on Desktop Packaging

This Docker setup does not build the Android client. GitHub Actions builds an Android APK and does not package the desktop app.
## MCP Server (Agent access)

With the existing Docker Compose deployment, the backend MCP endpoints are exposed through nginx (frontend container) so agents on the host do not need a published backend port. The optional full-stack Compose deployment exposes the same endpoint URLs directly from its single Node service:

| Endpoint | URL (default compose) | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|--------|
| Streamable HTTP | `http://localhost:8080/mcp` | Same URL for split Compose and optional full-stack Compose; preferred for Claude Code / modern clients |
| Legacy SSE | `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse` | Same URL for split Compose and optional full-stack Compose; GET opens `text/event-stream`, then clients POST to `/mcp/sse/messages?sessionId=…` |
| Legacy SSE (alias) | `http://localhost:8080/sse` | Same protocol; messages at `/messages?sessionId=…` |

**Desktop (Electron)** after enabling MCP in Settings:

| Endpoint | URL |
|----------|-----|
| Streamable HTTP | `http://127.0.0.1:3927/mcp` |
| Legacy SSE | `http://127.0.0.1:3927/sse` (messages: `/messages?sessionId=…`) |

1. Open the app → **Settings → MCP Server**.
2. Toggle **Enable MCP Server** (requires backend connection).
3. Copy the token (always viewable) and the JSON agent config.
4. Paste into Claude Code / Cursor MCP settings, for example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-stars-manager": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer gsm_mcp_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes**

- MCP uses a **separate token** from `API_SECRET` (backend UI auth). Resetting the MCP token does not break app↔backend sync.
- The MCP bearer is **stable**: stored encrypted in SQLite (`mcp_token`) on the backend, and in IndexedDB with other app state on desktop. It is created once when you first enable MCP and **only changes if you click Reset Token**.
- Pure frontend (no backend) does not show the MCP settings page.
- `gsm_vector_search` appears only when Vector Search is configured and enabled in the app.
- Enabling MCP is additive: existing SQLite data is unchanged; disabling MCP only stops the endpoint.
